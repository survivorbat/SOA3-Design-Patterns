# SOFA3 Design Patterns

A school assignment in which we had to create a domain model using design patterns taught in class

## Prerequisites

You need Docker to be able to run the tests and serve the coverage results at localhost. You can, however, use only phpunit if you want to.

## Getting started

Running `make run` will install the dependencies and create a coverage result. You can find the results at [localhost](http://localhost/).
